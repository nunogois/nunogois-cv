My CV (Curriculum Vitae) - HTML page with dynamic information that is perfectly printable / PDF

Have been using this CV for the past couple of years and decided to upload it to GitHub.
The HTML version should warn you in case your current version is not up-to-date. If you try to print it (paper or PDF) it should behave correctly.

There are many things I might improve in the meantime, such as:

 - Better dark mode;
 - Better responsiveness;
 - Review font sizes and overall aesthetic;
