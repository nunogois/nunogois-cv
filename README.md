My CV (Curriculum Vitae) - HTML page with dynamic information that is perfectly printable / PDF

Have been using this CV for the past couple of years and decided to upload it to GitHub.

There are many things I might improve in the meantime, such as:

 - Better dark mode;
 - Better responsiveness;
 - Review font sizes and overall aesthetic;
